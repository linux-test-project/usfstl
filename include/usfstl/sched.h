/*
 * usfstl's simple scheduler
 *
 * usfstl's concept of time is just a free-running counter. You can use
 * any units you like, but we recommend micro or nanoseconds, even
 * with nanoseconds you can simulate ~580 years in a uint64_t time.
 *
 * The scheduler is just a really basic concept, you enter "jobs"
 * and then call usfstl_sched_next() to run the next job. Usually,
 * this job would schedule another job and call usfstl_sched_next()
 * again, etc.
 *
 * The scheduler supports grouping jobs (currently into up to 32
 * groups) and then blocking certain groups from being executed in
 * the next iteration. This can be used, for example, to separate
 * in-SIM and out-of-SIM jobs, or threads from IRQs, etc. Note
 * that groups and priorities are two entirely separate concepts.
 *
 * In many cases, you'll probably be looking for usfstltask.h instead
 * as that allows you to simulate a cooperative multithreading system.
 * However, raw jobs may in that case be useful for things like e.g.
 * interrupts that come into the simulated system (if they're always
 * run-to-completion i.e. cannot yield to other jobs.)
 *
 * Additionally, the scheduler has APIs to integrate with another,
 * external, scheduler to synchronize multiple components.

 *
 * When cooperating with an external scheduler, it may be good to
 * avoid ping-pong all the time, if there's nothing to do. This
 * function facilitates that.
 *
 * Call it before returning from the sched_external_wait() method and
 * the scheduler will not sync for each internal job again, but
 * only when the next internal job would be at or later than the
 * time given as the argument here.
 *
 * Note that then you also have to coordinate with the external
 * scheduler every time there's any interaction with any other
 * component also driven by the external scheduler.
 *
 * To understand this, consider the following timeline, where the
 * letters indicate scheduler jobs:
 *  - component 1: A      C D E F
 *  - component 2:   B             G
 * Without calling this function, component 1 will always sync
 * with the external scheduler in component 2, for every job
 * it has. However, after the sync for job/time C, component
 * 2 knows that it will not have any job until G, so if it
 * tells component 1 (whatever RPC there is calls this function)
 * then component 1 will sync again only after F.
 *
 * However, this also necessitates that whenever the components
 * interact, this function could be called again. If you imagine
 * jobs C-F to just be empty ticks that do nothing then this
 * might not happen. However, if one of them causes interaction
 * with component 2 (say a network packet in the simulation) the
 * interaction may cause a new job to be inserted into the
 * scheduler timeline of component 2. Let's say, for example,
 * the job D was a transmission from component 1 to 2, and in
 * component 2 that causes an interrupt and a rescheduling. The
 * above timeline will thus change to:
 *  - component 1: A      C D E F
 *  - component 2:   B       N     G
 * inserting the job N. Thus, this very interaction needs to
 * call this function again with the time of N which will be at
 * or shortly after the time of D, rather than at G.
 *
 * This optimises things if jobs C-F don't cause interaction
 * with other components, and if considered properly in the RPC
 * protocol will not cause any degradation.
 *
 * If not supported, just never call this function and each and
 * every job will require external synchronisation.
